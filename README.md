# memory-game

This project is based on the famous "Simon" game. It has four coloured pads that flash in a randomly created sequence.

The game starts and flashes one coloured pad. The game player must then press that pad.

The game then adds an additional flash to the sequence and the game player must repeat the sequence.

If the game player repeats the sequence correctly, another flash is added to the sequence and the game
continues.

There are some game controls:

__Power__ - this must be turned on to power up the game!

_Play_ - the game starts when this is pressed

_Strict_ - If turned on, the game is considerably harder!
